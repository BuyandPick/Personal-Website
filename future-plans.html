            <h2>👩‍💻 Background</h2>
            <p>
                I am originally from Phoenix, Arizona, and come from a large family with four brothers. 
                My parents are from Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Mexico, and their work ethic and resilience 
                have strongly influenced my own approach to education and personal growth.
            </p>
</p> .
            <p>
            <p>
                As a Software Engineering student, I value discipline, adaptability, and continuous improvement. 
                Outside of coding, I enjoy music, gaming, and spending time with my daughter, Kleo. I believe that maintaining a balanced lifestyle helps me stay focused and motivated in my technical pursuits.

                <h2>🎯 Future Career Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    After graduation, I aim to join a collaborative development team where I can contribute 
                    to meaningful software projects while continuing to strengthen my technical skills.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am particularly interested in software development and artificial intelligence, 
                    but I remain open to exploring cybersecurity and other emerging technology fields. 
                    My long-term goal is to build a stable, fulfilling career that allows me to grow 
                    professionally while maintaining creativity and balance.
                </p>
